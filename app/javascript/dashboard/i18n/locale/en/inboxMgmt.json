It can be a live website chat, messages from social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, or messaging apps like Line, Telegram, or whatever else is cool these days. </p> <p> To keep things organized, you can create different inboxes for different communication channels. You can easily keep track of all customer conversations under the 'Conversations' tab. To view conversations specific to a particular inbox, click on the inbox name on the left-side panel of the dashboard. </p> <p> You can manage your existing inboxes from this page or add new ones using the 'Add inbox' button. The possibilities are endless - go ahead and add as many inboxes as you need!</p> <p> Open the Inboxes handbook in another tab for a helping hand.</p>",
